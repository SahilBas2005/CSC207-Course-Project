## Overview
Bracket Buddy is an Android application designed to help tournament organizers manage and run their tournaments locally 
through their mobile device. It interacts with the start.gg API for fetching and modifying the user's start.gg data. 
Bracket Buddy provides a user-friendly alternative to the "notoriously poor" start.gg website functionality on mobile 
devices. With Bracket Buddy, tournament organizers can save time and reduce frustration, making it an invaluable tool for 
managing tournaments on the go. 

## Features
- **Log in**: The tournament organizer (TO) can log into their start.gg account through our app.
- **Access tournaments and events**: The TO can access their current and upcoming tournaments and events.
- **Access and modify bracket matches**: The TO can see the bracket matches for a given event, declare the result 
of the match, and upload the changes to start.gg. 
- **Modify seeding**: The TO can modify the seeding for a bracket and upload the changes to start.gg. 
- **Call sets**: The TO can assign players to specific setups or stations.
- **Ensure controller compatibility**: The TO can keep track of players with limiting controllers while calling sets 
to ensure that players can only be called to setups where their controllers are compatible.
- **Track payments**: The TO can keep track of which attendees have paid, in order to calculate total revenue of the 
tournament and collect payment from unpaid entrants.
- **Generate Event Description**: The TO can generate a description for an event, which can be used for advertising 
the event.
